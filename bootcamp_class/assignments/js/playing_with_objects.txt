// Practice iterating through an array of objects/dictionaries.
// Imagine that you are given an array of objects.  For example,

var users = [
  {
    name: "Michael", age:37
  }, 
  {
    name: "John", age:30
  }, 
  {
    name: "David", age:27
  }
];

// 1.  How would you print/log John's age?
console.log(users[1].age); // Expected output => 30

// 2.  How would you print/log the name of the first object?
console.log('The name of user[1] is:', users[1].name);

// 3.  How would you print/log the name and age of each user using a for loop?  Your output should look something like this
for(var people in users){
  console.log(users[people].name + ', age: ' + users[people].age);
}
